# Arduino Yun Communication Library
The Arduino Yun Communication Library was developed as a replacement 
for the bridge library.  The goal was to allow the user to send and recieve 
messages from either the Arduino side or the Linux side.  

The Arduino side is c++ library that can be added to any Arduino sketch 
in the Arduino IDE.  The Linux side is a python library that should be added 
to any program that needs to communicate with the Arduino.

The idea was to allow the Arduino to perfom tasks independently of the other 
system, instead of relying on the Arduino to make Linux system calls and 
have to wait for them to finish.  This library allows you to sample a sensor 
continuously and not be burdened by other processes.
