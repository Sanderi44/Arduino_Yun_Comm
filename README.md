# Arduino Yun Communication Library
The Arduino Yun Communication Library was developed as a replacement 
for the bridge library.  The goal was to allow the user to send and recieve 
messages from either the Arduino side or the Linux side.  The library also lets the 
Arduino perfom tasks independently of the Linux system.  Instead of relying 
on the Arduino to make Linux system calls and having to wait for them to finish,
you can now perform tasks indepently.  This library allows you to sample a sensor 
continuously with out being interrupted by other processes.

The Arduino side is a c++ library that can be added to any Arduino sketch 
in the Arduino IDE.  The Linux side is a python library that should be added 
to any program that needs to communicate with the Arduino.
