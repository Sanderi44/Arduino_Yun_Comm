# Arduino Yun Communication Library
The Arduino Yun Communication Library was developed as a replacement\n
for the bridge library.  The goal was to allow the user to send and recieve \n
messages from either the Arduino side or the Linux side.  \n
\n
The Arduino side is c++ library that can be added to any Arduino sketch \n
in the Arduino IDE.  The Linux side is a python library that should be added \n
to any program that needs to communicate with the Arduino.

The idea was to allow the Arduino to perfom tasks independently of the other\n
system, instead of relying on the Arduino to make Linux system calls and \n
have to wait for them to finish.  This library allows you to sample a sensor \n
continuously and not be burdened by other processes.
